1	The rules must be simple enough so the user isn’t a doofus and breaks the program!
2	The game must be zero player game that requires hardly any user input.
3	It must be a limited of 36X36 grid. Max of infinite.
4	A live cell with less than 2 living cells dies because of under population
5	A live cell with 2 or 3 living cells next to it lives on to the next life.
6	A live cell with more than 3 live cells dies by over population.
7	A dead cell with no more or less than 3 living cells next to it becomes alive by reproduction.
8	There can’t be any explosive growth.
9	Small chaotic, unpredictable outcome must be in the program.
